# Autobot
42 Team Project

This repo regroups code and design documents created to build a robot with 3 microphones constantly listening to the environment. 
On detection of a sound, the robot performs a triangulation to locate the source and then goes towards it. 

Usage of Arduino or any similar board was not allowed.

We used a PIC32MX programmed via MPLABX. 
The PCB design was performed with Altium.

This project is not actively maintained.
